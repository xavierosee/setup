# setup

A repository with all the initial tools I need upon installing a new laptop.
I have two different scripts for mac and ubuntu, as I use different OS on my home and work laptops.

Inspired by [David Leuliette's](https://github.com/flexbox) and [Preslav Mihaylov](https://github.com/preslavmihaylov) similar repositories.
